# Covid19-charts

data5.xlsm is a macro-enabled workbook which allows user to create multiple charts on different aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic's progression. Every press of "Chart plot" creates a new chart with the inputs at that time, which can be dragged to be simultaneously viewed. Changeable inputs include countries, type of data (total/new cases/deaths/recoveries), chart type and axis scale.
